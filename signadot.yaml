# When a branch of this git repo is added to a workspace,
# the following k8s manifests will be checked against the
# base branch and any clonable objects (e.g. Deployments)
# that changed will be cloned into the workspace.
manifests:
  # Check manifests that are stored as raw k8s YAML/JSON files.
  #
  # The path is relative to the repo root and can be either a
  # single file or a directory, which can optionally be scanned
  # recursively.

  # Check manifests generated by a bash script.
  #
  # The script runs in your own cluster with an image that has
  # common tools like helm (v3) and kustomize. You can customize
  # this image to add your own tools if necessary.
